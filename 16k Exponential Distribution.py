Exponential Distribution:

Exponential distribution is used for describing time till next event e.g. failure/success etc.

It has two parameters:

scale - inverse of rate ( see lam in poisson distribution ) defaults to 1.0.

size - The shape of the returned array.

Example:

Draw out a sample for exponential distribution with 2.0 scale with 2x3 size:
'''
from numpy import random

x = random.exponential(scale=2, size=(2, 3))

print(x)
'''
Visualization of Exponential Distribution

Example:
'''
from numpy import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sns.distplot(random.exponential(size=1000), hist=False)

plt.show()
'''
Result

Relation Between Poisson and Exponential Distribution:

Poisson distribution deals with number of occurences of an event in a time period whereas exponential distribution deals with the
time between these events.
